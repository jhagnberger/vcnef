This repository contains the official PyTorch implementation of the VCNeF model from the ICML'24 paper,  
"[**Vectorized Conditional Neural Fields: A Framework for Solving Time-dependent Parametric Partial Differential Equations**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03919)".

## Requirements

The VCNeF model requires and is tested with the following packages.
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) in version 2.2.0
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org) in version 1.26.4
- [Einops](https://einops.rocks) in version 0.7.0


Please also see the [``requirements.txt``](./requirements.txt) file which contains all packages to run the provided examples.


## Usage

The following example shows how to use the VCNeF model.

```python
import torch
from vcnef.vcnef_1d import VCNeFModel as VCNeF1DModel
from vcnef.vcnef_2d import VCNeFModel as VCNeF2DModel
from vcnef.vcnef_3d import VCNeFModel as VCNeF3DModel

model = VCNeF2DModel(num_channels=4,
                     condition_on_pde_param=True,
                     pde_param_dim=2,
                     d_model=256,
                     n_heads=8,
                     n_transformer_blocks=1,
                     n_modulation_blocks=6)

# Random data with shape b, s_x, s_y, c
x = torch.rand(4, 64, 64, 4)
grid = torch.rand(4, 64, 64, 2)
pde_param = torch.rand(4, 2)
t = torch.arange(1, 21).repeat(4, 1) / 20

y_hat = model(x, grid, pde_param, t)
```

## Files
Below is a listing of the directory structure of VCNeF.

``examples.py``: Contains lightweight examples of how to use VCNeF. \
``examples_pde_bench.py``: Contains examples of how to use VCNeF with PDEBench data and the PDEBench training loop. \
``ðŸ“‚ vcnef``: Contains the code for the VCNeF model. \
``ðŸ“‚ utils``: Contains utils for the PDEBench example.


## Dataset for PDEBench Example

To use the PDEBench example ``examples_pde_bench.py``, you have to download the [PDEBench datasets](https://darus.uni-stuttgart.de/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.18419/darus-2986). An overview of the avaiable data and how to download it can be found in the [PDEBench repository](https://github.com/pdebench/PDEBench/tree/main/pdebench/data_download). To use the downloaded datasets in the example, you have to adapt the path in ``base_path`` and the file name(s) in ``file_names``.


## VCNeF Architecture
The following illustation shows the architecture of the VCNeF model for solving 2D time-dependent PDEs (e.g., Navier-Stokes equations).

  abstract = 	 {Transformer models are increasingly used for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Several adaptations have been proposed, all of which suffer from the typical problems of Transformers, such as quadratic memory and time complexity. Furthermore, all prevalent architectures for PDE solving lack at least one of several desirable properties of an ideal surrogate model, such as (i) generalization to PDE parameters not seen during training, (ii) spatial and temporal zero-shot super-resolution, (iii) continuous temporal extrapolation, (iv) support for 1D, 2D, and 3D PDEs, and (v) efficient inference for longer temporal rollouts. To address these limitations, we propose <em>Vectorized Conditional Neural Fields</em> (VCNeFs), which represent the solution of time-dependent PDEs as neural fields. Contrary to prior methods, however, VCNeFs compute, for a set of multiple spatio-temporal query points, their solutions in parallel and model their dependencies through attention mechanisms. Moreover, VCNeF can condition the neural field on both the initial conditions and the parameters of the PDEs. An extensive set of experiments demonstrates that VCNeFs are competitive with and often outperform existing ML-based surrogate models.}
